### Project Overview

 The project is about calculating the different prowess of superheroes and their ability to fight for humanity.
The data is divided into different attributes of heroes and helps in evaluating which superhero can lead us to save the world!!


### Learnings from the project

 I learned about manging data, displaying data in pie charts, bar graphs and subplots with the help of python



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach i took is to first diversify how many males and females were in the data to make the categorizing of attributes easier, organized the data into which superheroes have the most strength, power , intelligence.
Derived wheter there is a correlation between the power and intelligence of the superheroes , organized the data of top 0.01% of all superheroes who are the smartest and the most powerful. Finally, designed subplots based on intelligence, power and speed in case the superheroes go rogue on us!!!
